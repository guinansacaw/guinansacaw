## 👋 Hi there, I'm William Guiñansaca. 🤝🤝

I really like coding, storytelling, and data viz. This is an entirely new world for me, so it's a challenge. However, it's a very satisfying challenge when I achieve my goals. I'm excited about all the new things I will be able to do.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my RStudio skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statistics, SQL, PowerBI, and Excel.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will allow me to learn.

## 🐦 Do not forget 🐦
- 💬 Ask me about anything and if you have some feedback, you're welcome!
- 🌐 Check out my Web Portfolio: https://guinansacaw.github.io/
